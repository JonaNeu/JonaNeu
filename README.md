# Hi, I'm Jona


Since my childhood, I am fascinated with computers and what we can achieve with them. During my computer science studies at the Technical University of Munich, I became interested in entrepreneurship and start-ups. So, I started to design websites and selling things on Amazon FBA. Later, I co-founded UnicornPitch & Slidepress to disrupt the way businesses buy graphic design services. Even though the company didnâ€™t work out, I learned a lot during this time in so many areas. I later worked at enmacc, a FinTech startup from Munich, where I led a development team focused on the platform's infrastructure and architecture while also delivering new features for clients. Currently, I am working as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon.
