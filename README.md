# Hi, I'm Jona

Since my childhood, I am obsessed with computers and what we can achieve with them. During my computer science studies at the Technical University of Munich, I also became interested in entrepreneurship and start-ups. So, I started selling on Amazon FBA as a first project. Later I co-founded UnicornPitch to disrupt the way businesses buy graphic design services. I build the entire tech part of the company and learned a lot about technology and business. Currently I am working as a software engineer at a fintech startup.
